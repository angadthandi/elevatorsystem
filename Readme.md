# Design Elevator System

1) Elevator has a set of m buttons, one for each floor.
2) Button illuminates when pressed and cause the elevator to visit the corresponding floor. Illumination is canceled when the elevator visits the corresponding floor.
3) Each floor, except the first(ground) floor and top floor has two buttons, one to request an up-elevator and one to request a down-elevator.
4) There is only one down-call button at the top floor and one up-call button in the lobby.
5) When the car stops at a floor, the doors are opened.
6) When doors are opened, car lantern illuminates indicating the current direction the car is going, so that the passengers can get to know the current moving direction of the car.
